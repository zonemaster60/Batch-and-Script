Addons
======

1. In order to use the 'ADDONS menu' you must first create a blank 'addons.txt'
2. Place the 'addons.txt' next to your Handy2ClickAutoFixer.exe.
(This will create the 'addons\' folder)
3. You can edit this text file and add just the filenames. (not the .exe)

like this:
	filename1
	filename2
	filename3

4. Put your '.exe' files in the the 'addons\' folder.
(You can have up to 8 addons.)

Backups
=======

The default 'backups' folder created at startup is good for most users.
If you wish to change this, create a "backups.txt" and add your
path on the first line and save it.

like this:
	C:\RegBackups

or whatever you path is.
