Addons
======

1. In order to use the 'ADDONS menu' you must first create a blank 'addons.txt'
2. Place the 'addons.txt' next to your Handy2ClickAutoFixer.exe.
(This will create the 'addons\' folder)
3. You can edit this text file and add just the filenames. (not the .exe)

like this:
	filename
	or...
	folder\filename

4. Put your '.exe' files in the the 'addons\' folder.
(You can have up to 16 addons.)
