# Batch-and-Scripts
 Batch files, Utilities, Examples, and Command Scripts.

 To compile you will need http://www.battoexeconverter.com for the batch script
 and PureBasic http://www.purebasic.com. Maker sure to embed the file loadweblinks.exe
 BEFORE you compile the batch script

 Apparently 'code signing' is a thing. Unfortunately I DO NOT have $500 for a code signing certicate. 
 So if you wish to download and run ANY of these files or code be WARNED you will get Fake AV warnings,
 OR the code/program may not work at all. You have been advised.
